<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project we highlight the differences between JSX and HTML in a REACT
application:
<p> 
  JSX is literally pure JavaScript but browsers do not know how to read JSX
  so that's why we use Babel to convert it into JavaScript.
</p>

### Differences between html and jsx:
* Adding custom stying to an element uses different syntax
* Adding a class to an element uses different syntax-> Use className="btn"
* JSX can reference JS variables very easly.
* Diferent syntax for the for property on labels use this syntax htmlFor="name"

### Built With
The project was developed using these tools and technologies.
* [REACT](https://es.reactjs.org/)
* [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
